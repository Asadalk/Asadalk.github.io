# Decisions

## 2026-10-16 · Phase 0 and owner answers

- **Research numbers come only from the owner's résumé (Oct 2026).** No other source is used for research figures. Where the public fork's README reports a differently defined comparison, the résumé's figure is the one shown.
- **Owner approved public research results and hosting the model.**
- **OpsPilot retrieval is described as lexical-vector, not semantic.** It uses 128-d hashed bag-of-words vectors (ADR-0002 in the repo).
- **Unflattering results stay**, for example OpsBench misleading-evidence 0/8 and the ensemble's 40.3% precision.
- **SmokeTrail is "in progress" with no numbers.** The hero haze will use a fixed value until real data exists.
- **Archive curated to 6 repos** with real owner work and code: NLU-Assignment-2, DL-PhaseII, Sports-Or-Politics, Socket_Programming, Project-CSL1010, Product-Recommendation-System (team credit stated). Hidden: PRML-Spring-2023 (no owner commits), Logistic-Regression (no code), Linear-Regression (course boilerplate, missing data), EPMFDS (mostly empty files).
- **Cellular demo video is self-hosted**, copied from the repo's README attachment, so no runtime request goes to GitHub. The README's terminal screenshot was left out because it shows a username, internal IPs and a real cell ID.
- **OpsPilot traces** were produced by running the real stack with Groq `openai/gpt-oss-120b` on 2026-10-16 (see `src/content/data/opspilot/README.md`).

## 2026-10-16 · Phase 1

- **Astro 7.3.5, not 7.4.0.** Every dependency is pinned exactly to a version published at least two weeks before the build. TypeScript is pinned to 5.9.3 because `@astrojs/check` does not support TS 7 yet.
- **vitest was added with `--legacy-peer-deps`** to work around an npm 10.9 arborist crash. The resulting lockfile installs cleanly with plain `npm ci`.
- **Two contrast fixes to the palette:** a link-only `--accent-ink` (#963B24, 5.07:1 on Plaster) and a Kohl edge on the chartreuse focus ring (the ring alone is 1.13:1 on Lime-wash).
- **The Phase 1 hero is text only.** The illustrated street (Phase 2) replaces it. The signboard labels already appear as a bilingual section nav.
- **The mini-bar has 3 of its 4 items.** The brain panel button arrives with the brain in Phase 5.
- **Bio and about text were written by Claude from the résumé and repos**, at the owner's request. Every claim in them maps to a content fact.
